In this video, I'm going to show you how you could build your very first streamlit web application in Python. So the first thing that you need to do is install streamlit. And so let's create a file called app PY, three quotation opening and a three quotation closing in order to allow it to be in markdown mode. So the hashtag means the h one heading and we're making it bold. And then the second word here, we'll make it in italic and then we'll save it. And then we'll head back to run it streamlit. And then voila. You have created your very first streamlit web application in Python.
