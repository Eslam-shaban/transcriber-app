00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,550
In this video, I'm going to show you how you could build your very first

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,846
streamlit web application in Python. So the first thing that

3
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:09,390
you need to do is install streamlit.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,190
And so let's create a file called app PY,

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,178
three quotation opening and a three quotation

6
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:24,934
closing in order to allow it to be in markdown mode. So the

7
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:31,974
hashtag means the h one heading and

8
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:35,734
we're making it bold. And then the second word here, we'll make it

9
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:39,606
in italic and then we'll save it. And then

10
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,310
we'll head back to run it streamlit.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,906
And then voila. You have created your very first streamlit

12
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:51,054
web application in Python. If your finding value in this
